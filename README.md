## Getting Started
### Data Collecting
In the data collecting stage, we collect three types of the dataset: a) papers,  we collect papers from specific scientific domains. In current project, we collect papers 
from two domains: bioinformatics, neuroscience; b) tools, we collect types of tools; c) datasets, we collect types of datasets. To collect papers, we 
provide scripts to automatically collect papers from websites; to collect tools or datasets, we need some domain knowledge to collect relevant datasets manually.
 
(Note, we have already collected the relevant dataset. it is not necessary to run the data collecting script unless you want to collect new dataset from new domain). 
- Collect papers from bioinformatics domain
```
python data_collector.py --domain bio
```
- Collect papers from neuroscience domain
```
python data_collector.py --domain neuro
```
- Tips: Collect papers from other domains and other scripts
    - You need to mimic the scripts (such as bmc_bio_collector.py, bmc_genomics_collector.py) under the folders to extract text from websites. 

### Data Processing
During the data collecting, you have collected paper texts from journals. In the data processing stage, you need to process raw text datasets for suitable dataset format
for the model. In our model, we use bag-of-words as model input. Hence,
